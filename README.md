## Introduction

ZASM is designed to provide a lightweight and efficient runtime for WebAssembly and WASI. It is intended to be used as a plugin system for games and other applications that require fast and efficient execution of WebAssembly modules.

## Features

- Simple and lightweight runtime for WebAssembly and WASI
- Blazingly fast performance
- Optimized for embedding as a plugin system
- Easy to use API

## Getting Started

To get started with ZASM, you will need to have Zig installed on your system. Once you have Zig installed, you can clone the ZASM repository and build the runtime using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b4rti/zasm.git cd zasm zig build
```

This will build the ZigWasm runtime and generate a static library that you can link to your application.

## Usage

To use ZASM in your application, you will need to link against the static library generated by the build process. You can then use the ZASM API to load and execute WebAssembly modules.

Here's an example of how to load and execute a WebAssembly module using ZASM:

```zig
const wasm = @import("zasm");

pub fn main() !void {
    const module = try wasm.load_module("path/to/module.wasm");
    const instance = try module.instantiate();
    const result = try instance.call("function_name", 1, 2, 3);
    // Do something with the result...
}
```
For more information on how to use the ZigWasm API, please refer to the API documentation.
