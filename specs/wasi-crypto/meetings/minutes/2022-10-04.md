* The "hostcalls" implementation is not meant to be a reference implementation, but something that can be actually used in Wasmtime. It is big, not language-agnostic, and it being a reference implementation would incompatible with making it more complicated and adding optimizations.
* Proposal: write a simple reference implememtation in Go or Python, that focuses on readability and is as close to the specification as possible.
* A test suite is much needed.
* At least we should do cross-implementation testing between the rust implementation and the wasmedge implementation.
* Recommended/required algorithms: classify by tiers (Richard, Frank, PR #77) -- Elliptic curves may not be recommended, as some organizations may still not allow them, for compliance with older recommendations.
* The wasi-crypto crate should support both BoringSSL (required for performance and compliance) and Rust implementations (required for Enarx).
